Turbot is a group effort to bring some entertainment to IRC.  It has been built for `#tamparb` by `#tamparb`.  Not in the Tampa area?  Don't worry you can easily get turbot up and running in your own channel. If you want to contribute to Turbot there is a section below that will help you do so.

#### Gem Search

#### Github Status

This plugin reports the status of Github. (Duh).  It also periodically reports if the status is down.

#### Help

If this plugin isn't blocked for flooding the channel it reports an ascii table that tells you how to access all the commands.  ^\_^

#### Make Me a Sandwich

Ask if Turbot will make you a sandwich.  I kinda doubt he will.

#### Reddit Joke

Ask turbot to tell you a joke.

#### URL Handler

Arguably the most useful plugin.  Prints short summary for a given url.  Does special formatting for youtube, twitter, et al.
